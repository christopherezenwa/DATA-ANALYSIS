Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TVshows, movies, anime and documentaries. In this project i carried out an exploratory data analysis on the netflix listing 2015-2021 dataset i got from kaggle. I used DAX in powerBI to create measures so as to derive meaningful insights and most importantly to determine which directors had the highest amount of contents.
